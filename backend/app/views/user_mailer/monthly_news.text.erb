Hello <%= @user.name %>,

Welcome to another month's happenings with the new stuff this month:

<% if self.reasons_for_notifications.include? :recently_created_broadcasts  %>
   Here are the new broadcasts at Rundfunk Mitbestimmen since you last logged in:
    <% broadcasts_created_since_last_login.each do |b| %>
      <%= b.title %>
    <% end %>
<% end %>


<% if self.reasons_for_notifications.include? :no_given_amount_for_supported_broadcasts  %>
  It looks like you have supported broadcasts without actually distributing your funds for your
  selected broadcasts. Please log in and distribute funds for your favorite programs!
<% end %>

<% if self.reasons_for_notifications.include? :unbalanced_distribution  %>
  It looks like you have distributed all of your funds to one particular broadcast, are you sure
  that was your intention? If not, then please log in and explore more broadcasts and distribute your funds
  to those. If that was your intention, then please ignore this message!
<% end %>

Thank you for being a valued member of Rundfunk Mitbestimmen! We hope you will check back soon to see
these new updates!

Best Regards,
The Rundfunk Mitbestimmen team
