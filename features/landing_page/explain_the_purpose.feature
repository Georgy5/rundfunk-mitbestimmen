Feature: Explain the purpose
  As a visitor
  I want to see a short paragraph of text with general information on the landing page
  To understand the purpose of the app

  Scenario:
    When I visit the landing page
    Then I can read:
    """
    Unfortunately, people do not have a say how the monthly â‚¬17.50 are used. We want to change that: You decide how your contribution should be spent.
    """
